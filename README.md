A simple functional programming language.

This project is my BSc thesis. I implement a relatively simple functional programming language by writing an interpreter in Haskell.
The language itself is strongly inspired by the syntax and features of Haskell. It supports basic parameterised algebraic data types,
higher rank parametric polymorphism and some limited IO operations. It also includes a standard library.
